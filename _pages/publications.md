        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Mean-field microkinetic models (MKMs) are appealing for their relatively facile construction, computational tractability, and high-throughput catalyst screening capabilities. As such, they will continue to be a valuable tool for materials design in heterogeneous catalysis even as the field aims to describe more complex systems. Numerous prior reports have provided the groundwork for constructing first-principles-based MKMs, including the analysis of strategies for incorporating lateral interactions into thermodynamic parameters (e.g., adsorption energies). Yet, there remains a need for concerted dialogue on methods for calculating and incorporating coverage-dependent kinetic parameters into MKMs. In this Perspective, we assess strategies for doing so, including the corresponding key physical implications and computational challenges. We emphasize that decoupling thermodynamic and kinetic parameters within MKMs can violate thermodynamic consistency and risk unphysical solutions. For some reactions and catalyst materials, scaling relationships can predict coverage-dependent activation energies, but there are several exceptions evident in the literature, indicating that this approach is not universally applicable and that the field could benefit from research aimed at elucidating the limitations. Conducting high-coverage transition state searches is a rigorous but computationally costly strategy, and the effects of various methods for mitigating this cost on resulting energetics have yet to be broadly explored and validated. The goal of this Perspective is to generate discussion on and inspire focused research into the physical relevance of approaches for describing coverage-dependent reaction barriers in MKMs, including the development of computationally tractable methodologies, to advance the applicability of MKMs across diverse reaction chemistries and conditions.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Heterogeneous catalysis is driven by the interaction of reactant molecules and the catalyst surface. The locus of this interaction as well as the surrounding ensemble of atoms is referred to as the catalyst active site. Active site characterization attempts to distinguish active catalytic sites from inactive surface sites, to elucidate the structural and chemical nature of active sites, and to quantify active site concentration. Numerous techniques have been demonstrated to provide compositional and structural information about the active sites within a catalyst. However, each technique has its own limitations and experimental pitfalls that can lead to data misinterpretation or irreproducible results. This work aims to provide an overview of the types of data that can be collected, to outline common experimental challenges and how to avoid them, and to assemble relevant references for the most used active site characterization techniques. More broadly, we aim to outline best practices for researchers to collect, interpret, and report active site characterization data in a way that provides the most benefit to the broader catalysis community. Increasing the rigor and reproducibility of active site characterization offers a strategy to better link properties with catalytic performance and to enable the community to develop consensus concerning these relationships.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        This work combines kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods to understand mechanistic details of toluene alkylation with ethylene on acidic MOR zeolite, chosen due to its industrial relevance in producing ethyltoluene. In doing so, we show that the protons in the small eight-membered-ring (8-MR) micropores are inaccessible to large toluene molecules, which were selectively titrated with Na<sup>+</sup> prior to kinetic measurements. Kinetic data, taken together with in situ infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, show that all protons in the 12-MR are saturated with π-bonded toluene, favoring thermodynamic stability due to extensive dispersive interactions with the porous structure. The π-bonded toluene reacts with ethylene in a concerted manner, where the protonation of ethylene and C–C coupling occurs concurrently. The C–C formation at the *ortho* position takes precedence over *meta* and *para* locations, although the free energies of C–C coupling transition states show marginal differences. Consequently, all three isomers are formed as primary products, with an *ortho*, *meta*, and *para* ratio of 3:1:1 (<0.2% conversion; 503 K). Undesired ethylene dimerization products remained undetectable on partially Na<sup>+</sup>-exchanged MOR samples under all conditions, consistent with larger DFT-derived barriers for C–C coupling between two ethylene molecules than between toluene and ethylene, reflecting the role of 12-MR micropores that selectively stabilize the latter transition state. These results provide mechanistic insights into aromatic alkylation and the role of micropores on rates and selectivities, which will ultimately inform design strategies for solid acid catalysts with improved catalytic performance.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are poised to play a key role in reducing capital cost and materials criticality concerns associated with traditional low-temperature electrolysis technologies. To accelerate the development and deployment of this technology, an in-depth understanding of cell materials integration is essential. Notably, the complex chemistries and interactions within the catalyst layer (consisting of the anode/cathode catalyst, anion exchange ionomer, and their interfaces with the transport layers and membrane) collectively influence overall cell performances, lifetimes, and costs. This review outlines recent advances in understanding the catalyst layer in AEMWEs. Specifically, electrode development strategies (including catalyst deposition techniques and configurations as well as transport layer design strategies) and our current understanding of catalyst–ionomer interactions are discussed. Effects of cell assembly and operational variables (including compression, temperature, pressure, and electrolyte conditions) on cell performance are also discussed. Lastly, we consider cutting-edge *in situ* and *ex situ* diagnostic techniques to study the complex chemistries within the catalyst layer as well as discuss degradation mechanisms that arise due to the integration of cell components. Simultaneously, comparisons are made to proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) and liquid alkaline water electrolyzers (LAWE) throughout the review to provide context to researchers transitioning into the AEMWE space. We also include recommendations for standard operating procedures, configurations, and metrics for comparing activity and stability.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) hydrogenation on transition-metal active sites offers a promising carbon utilization route toward mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. C<sub>1</sub> products are often formed in parallel during CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation, prompting investigations into the intrinsic properties of transition metals that drive activity and product selectivity. In this work, close-packed surfaces of a selection of transition-metal catalysts (Ni, Co, Rh, Ru, Pd, and Pt) were studied with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand their fundamental reactivities for CO<sub>2</sub> transformation reactions. Results indicate that CO<sub>2</sub> conversion proceeds through CO<sup>*</sup> formation and hydrogenation to form C<sub>1</sub> products (<sup>*</sup> denotes an adsorbed species). Ni, Co, Rh, and Ru favor CO/CH<sub>4</sub> formation, while Pd and Pt favor CO/CH<sub>3</sub>OH formation. The ability of a metal to dissociate C-O bonds drives selectivity between CH<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>OH, while competition between CO<sup>*</sup> desorption and surface hydrogenation describes CO selectivities. The C-O bond dissociation steps often impose the highest barrier along CH<sub>4</sub> formation reaction profiles, suggesting their kinetic relevance for CH<sub>4</sub> formation rates. The provided DFT-derived data sets detail a comprehensive reaction network of elementary steps relevant to C<sub>1</sub> chemistries, ultimately offering a benchmark for insights into design strategies for materials that exploit transition-metal active sites in carbon capture or utilization processes.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        The direct synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> provides a green pathway to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a popular industrial oxidant. Here, we theoretically investigate the effects of Pd oxidation states, coordination environments, and particle sizes on primary H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> selectivities, assessed by calculating the ratio of rate constants for the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (*via* OOH* reduction; k<sub>O–H</sub>) and the decomposition of OOH* (via O–O cleavage; k<sub>O–O</sub>). For Pd metals, the k<sub>O–H</sub>/k<sub>O–O</sub> ratio decreased from 10−4 for Pd(111) to 10−10 for the Pd<sub>13</sub> cluster at 300 K, indicating poorer H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> selectivity as Pd particle size decreases and low primary selectivities for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overall. As the oxygen chemical potential increases and metals form surface and bulk oxides, the perturbation of Pd–Pd ensemble sites by lattice O atoms results in selectivities that become dramatically higher than unity. For instance, at 300 K, the k<sub>O–H</sub>/k<sub>O–O</sub> ratio increases significantly from 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>16</sup> as Pd(111) oxidizes to Pd<sub>5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Pd(111) and to PdO(100), respectively. In contrast, such selectivity enhancements are not observed for surface and bulk oxides that persistently contain rows of more metallic, undercoordinated Pd–Pd ensemble sites, such as PdO(101)/Pd(100) and PdO(101). These Pd–Pd ensembles are also absent when smaller Pd nanoparticles fully oxidize, indicating that smaller PdO clusters can be more selective for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis. These trends for primary H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> selectivities were found to inversely correlate with trends for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition rates via O–O bond cleavage, demonstrating that catalysts with high primary H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> selectivity can also hinder H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition. Ab initio thermodynamic calculations are used to estimate the thermodynamically favored phase among Pd, PdO/Pd and PdO in O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> environments. These results are combined to show that smaller Pd nanoparticles are more prone to be oxidized at lower oxygen chemical potentials, upon which they become more selective than larger Pd particles for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis.

        The activities and stabilities of non-platinum group metals (PGMs) in the forms of monometallic (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, NiO) and bimetallic (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CoNiO2) oxides were assessed for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media and compared with IrO<sub>2</sub>. Both half-cell, rotating disc electrode (RDE) apparatus and single-cell, membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) were used to study kinetic and device-level performance in parallel and to provide insights into the use of these materials in anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers. Normalization of RDE results by geometric and physical surface areas, double layer capacitance, and metal content probed differences in physically vs electrochemically accessible surface areas and ensured reported trends were independent of the normalization method. The results showed that: (i) Ni- and Co- containing materials met or exceeded IrO<sub>2</sub> performance in both RDE and MEA testing, (ii) Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> deactivated over time-on-stream (1.8 V for 13.5 h) due to oxide and, relatedly, particle growth, (iii) NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> increased in activity over time-on-stream due to dissolution of Fe and an increased Ni/Fe ratio, and (iv) reduction of catalyst layer resistance is an avenue to further increase device-level performance. These results demonstrated the clear viability for non-PGMs to be used as anode catalysts in AEM devices.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Formic acid (HCOOH) has emerged as a promising H<sub>2</sub> energy carrier due to its reasonable gravimetric
        and volumetric H<sub>2</sub> densities, low toxicity, low flammability, and ease of handling. Its possible productions from biogenic feedstocks also make it an attractive source to produce H<sub>2</sub> on demand. The utilization of HCOOH as a liquid H<sub>2</sub>
        carrier requires catalytic systems to selectively dehydrogenate HCOOH at low temperatures without forming CO products that can act as a poison in fuel cell applications. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding HCOOH decomposition via dehydrogenation (to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>) and dehydration (to CO/H<sub>2</sub>O) pathways on transition
        metals, including Cu, Pt, Pd, and Au. The focus is on discussing the surface chemistry of HCOOH reactions on transition metals, including the types of bound intermediates and the identity and kinetic relevance of elementary steps. In
        doing so, we review current catalyst design strategies for HCOOH dehydrogenation to facilitate the future development of catalytic processes for H<sub>2</sub> storage/utilization.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        The elementary steps and site requirements in formic acid (HCOOH) dehydrogenation on Cu surfaces remain of keen interest because formate species act as intermediates or spectators in methanol synthesis and water–gas shift reactions. Steady-state and transient kinetic data, isotopic effects, infrared spectra during catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, and theoretical treatments based on density functional theory (DFT) provide evidence for bimolecular reactions, in which saturated bidentate formate (*HCOO*) adlayers, present at 0.25 ML (0.25 *HCOO* per surface Cu atom), react with undissociated species (HCOOH<sup>□</sup>) bound at interstices within formate adlayers (<sup>□</sup>) to form H-bonded bimolecular HCOOH<sup>□</sup>-*HCOO* adducts. The co-existence of vicinal HCOOH<sup>□</sup> and *HCOO* moieties is evident from antisymmetric infrared bands for *HCOO* that become stronger as a result of their H-bonding that perturbs the induced dipole moment of *HCOO* upon vibration, consistent with DFT-derived vibrational frequencies and intensities for such perturbed species. The *HCOO* moiety in this complex undergoes C-H activation via a transition state that is preferentially stabilized through H-bonding with the vicinal HCOOH<sup>□</sup> relative to its *HCOO* precursor. DFT-derived HCOOH dehydrogenation activation barriers and those determined from the evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> from pre-adsorbed *HCOO* species are about 10 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> smaller in the presence of gaseous HCOOH reactants (because of HCOOH<sup>□</sup>-*HCOO* interactions) than those for the unimolecular decomposition of bound *HCOO* species. Such bimolecular routes are consistent with measured effects of HCOOH, H2, and CO pressures and of H/D isotopic substitution on dehydrogenation turnover rates and represent the predominant channel for the formation of CO<sub>2</sub> and H2 during catalytic HCOOH dehydrogenation on Cu nanoparticles. A saturated *HCOO* adlayer that retains binding interstices and the presence of HCOOH(g) enable a sequence of elementary steps unavailable for *HCOO* species, thus circumventing unassisted unimolecular routes that exhibit higher activation barriers.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Formic acid (HCOOH) decomposition is often used to assess the acid–base properties of oxide surfaces. Its reverse reaction forms HCOOH and formate species that can act as intermediates in CO<sub>2</sub>/CO/H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O reactions that are important in C<sub>1</sub> conversions. This study describes the mechanism of HCOOH dehydration on acid–base pairs at anatase and rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces through spectroscopic, desorption-reaction, kinetic, isotopic, and theoretical methods. HCOOH dehydration turnover rates are measured at coverages that allow bound intermediates to interact directly with Ti<sub>5c</sub>–O<sub>2c</sub> pairs. Such rates then reflect their acid–base properties without interference from a refractory bidentate formate adlayer that acts as the catalytic surface at lower temperatures, as evident from infrared and desorption reaction data. HCOOH dehydration elementary steps involve the concurrent activation of C–O and C–H bonds in a molecularly bound HCOOH (HCOOH*) by a Ti<sub>5c</sub>–O<sub>2c</sub> pair at the kinetically relevant step. The transition state mediating this step involves the OH group and the H-atom of the C–H group in HCOOH* that are almost fully transferred to the Ti<sub>5c</sub> and the vicinal O<sub>2c</sub> center, respectively. Such concerted interactions with the acid and base centers and the late character of the transition state render the H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation energy at Ti<sub>5c</sub>–O<sub>2c</sub> pairs a more suitable descriptor of HCOOH reactivity than the respective strengths of each Lewis center. These mechanistic conclusions allow quantitative inferences of the rate and kinetic parameters for HCOOH synthesis from CO–H<sub>2</sub>O reactants on TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces through the tenets of microscopic reversibility extended to the sequence of elementary steps. The results also illustrate how acid–base pairs act in concert to stabilize the relevant transition states, thus making the balance between acid and base strengths, instead of their independent properties, the rigorous arbiters of reactivity, as shown by the similar reactivities and H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation energies on Ti<sub>5c</sub>–O<sub>2c</sub> pairs at anatase and rutile surfaces in spite of their very different acid and base strengths.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Selective oxidation of cyclohexene to 2-cyclohexen-1-one over titania supported vanadia (VO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>) has been studied using temperature dependent in situ FTIR spectroscopy in both the presence and absence of oxygen. The VO<sub>x</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> samples were prepared using one atomic layer deposition (ALD) cycle and characterized by Raman spectroscopy. In situ FTIR data for the oxidation of cyclohexene and perdeuterocyclohexene allow for the formulation of a molecular level reaction mechanism, which is initiated by the transfer of an allyl hydrogen. Oxidation of perdeuterocyclohexene provides a direct probe of the formation of OD and HDO moieties that support the involvement of specific steps in the proposed mechanism. The presence of gas phase oxygen does not lead to a change in the products versus anaerobic conditions. However, gas phase oxygen is significantly incorporated in the CO<sub>2</sub> overoxidation product above ∼250 °C. Data were also obtained with cyclohexene epoxide as the reactant in an effort to determine whether there is a parallel reaction pathway, which is initiated by C═C activation in cyclohexene, that involves cyclohexene epoxide as an intermediate. Though a minor pathway involving a cyclohexene epoxide intermediate cannot be ruled out, these data demonstrate that, under experimental conditions, the dominant pathway from cyclohexene to cyclohexene-1-one is initiated by an allyl-H activation step and does not involve an epoxide intermediate.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Mechanistic details of HCOOH decomposition routes provide valuable insights into reactions involving bound formates as intermediates or spectators; these routes are also widely used as a probe of the acid-base properties of oxide surfaces. The identity and kinetic relevance of bound intermediates, transition states, and elementary steps are reported here for HCOOH dehydration on anatase and rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces through complementary kinetic, isotopic, spectroscopic and theoretical assessments. Five-coordinate exposed Ti<sub>5c</sub> centers are saturated with bidentate formates (*HCOO*) at catalytic conditions (423–463 K; 0.1–3 kPa HCOOH), as evident from infrared spectra collected during catalysis and the amounts of HCOOH and CO evolved upon heating the TiO<sub>2</sub> samples containing pre-adsorbed HCOOH-derived species. These *HCOO* species are inactive but form a stable “surface template” that contains stochiometric protons onto which HCOOH binds molecularly (HCOOH-H*) to form a coexisting adlayer. H<sub>2</sub>O elimination from HCOOH-H* is the sole kinetically-relevant step. DFT-derived barriers show that this step involves its reaction with Ti<sub>5c</sub>-O<sub>2c</sub> that acts as a Lewis acid-base pair. Such route, in turn, requires the access of HCOOH-H* to a Ti<sub>5c</sub> center, which is made available through a momentary reprotonation of a *HCOO*. This step is much less facile on rutile than on anatase due to stronger acid strength of its Ti<sub>5c</sub> centers that binds *HCOO* species more strongly and its shorter Ti<sub>5c</sub>-Ti<sub>5c</sub> distances that induce greater repulsions between co-adsorbed HCOOH* formed upon reprotonation step. These differences account for low dehydration reactivity of rutile at these temperatures. This mechanistic interpretation is in full accord with DFT-derived barriers, binding energies, and kinetic isotope effects that quantitatively agree with the values from regressed kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, with in-situ infrared spectra that identify HCOOH-H* species as the sole reactive intermediates, and with the differences in turnover rates between anatase and rutile catalysts. These dehydration routes are also consistent with the surface chemistry expected for Lewis acid-base pairs on stoichiometry TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces without requiring the presence or involvement of reduced centers or titanols in the catalytic cycle. The reaction routes described in this work show how strongly-bound species, evident in presence and unreactive nature from <em>in-situ</em> infrared spectra, provide an organic “permanent” template for reactions of weakly-bound species that are often invisible in spectroscopy.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        The activation of dioxygen at typically isolated two-electron reduced centers can lead to the formation of electrophilic superoxo or peroxo species, providing an essential route to form reactive O<sub>2</sub>-derived species in biological, organometallic, and heterogeneous catalysts. Alternatively, O<sub>2</sub> activation can proceed via outer sphere routes, circumventing the formation of bound peroxo (OO<sup>*</sup>) species during oxidation catalysis by forming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g), which can react with another reduced center to form H<sub>2</sub>O. The electronic and binding properties of metal oxides that determine the relative rates of these activation routes are assessed here by systematic theoretical treatments using density functional theory (DFT). These methods are combined with conceptual frameworks based on thermochemical cycles and crossing potential models to assess the most appropriate descriptors for the activation barriers for each route using Keggin polyoxometalates as illustrative examples. In doing so, we show that inner sphere routes, which form OO<sup>*</sup> species via O<sub>2</sub> activation on the O-vacancies (*) formed in the reduction part of redox cycles, are mediated by early transition states that only weakly sense the oxide binding properties. Outer sphere routes form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g) via O<sub>2</sub> activation on OH pairs (H/OH<sup>*</sup>) formed by dissociation of H<sub>2</sub>O on O-vacancies; their rates and activation barriers reflect the rates of the first H-atom transfer from H/OH<sup>*</sup> to O<sub>2</sub>. The activation barriers for this H-transfer step depend on the binding energy of more weakly-bound H-atom in H/OH<sup>*</sup> pairs (HAE<sub>2</sub>) and on the <sup>.</sup>OOH-surface interaction energy at its product state (<em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em>). The <em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em> values are similar among oxides unless a large charge-balancing cation is present and interacts with <sup>.</sup>OOH; consequently, HAE<sub>2</sub> acts as an appropriate descriptor of the outer sphere dynamics. HAE<sub>2</sub> also determines the thermodynamics of H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation on O-vacancies, which influence the inner and outer sphere rates by setting the relative coverage of * and H/OH<sup>*</sup>. These results, in turn, show that HAE<sub>2</sub> is a complete descriptor of the reactivity and selectivity of oxides for O<sub>2</sub> activation; the O-atoms in more reducible oxides (more negative HAE<sub>2</sub>) exhibit a greater preference for the inner sphere routes and for the formation of electrophilic OO<sup>*</sup> intermediates that mediate epoxidation and O-insertion reactions during catalytic redox cycles. Large charge-balancing cations locally modify <em>E<sub>int</sub><sup>0</sup></em> values that determine the outer sphere rates and thus can be used to alter the preference of O-atoms to either inner or outer sphere routes.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Catalytic redox cycles involve dioxygen activation via peroxo (OO<sup>∗</sup>) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> species, denoted as inner-sphere and outer-sphere routes respectively, for metal-oxo catalysts solvated by liquids. On solid oxides, O<sub>2</sub> activation is typically more facile than the reduction part of redox cycles, making kinetic inquiries difficult at steady-state. These steps are examined here for oxidative alkanol dehydrogenation (ODH) by scavenging OO<sup>∗</sup> species with C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> to form epoxides and by energies and barriers from density functional theory. Alkanols react with O-atoms (O∗) in oxides to form vicinal OH pairs that eliminate H<sub>2</sub>O to form OO<sup>∗</sup> at O-vacancies formed or react with O<sub>2</sub> to give H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. OO<sup>∗</sup> reacts with alkanols to re-form O∗ via steps favored over OO<sup>∗</sup> migrations, otherwise required to oxidize non-vicinal vacancies. <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 epoxidizes by reaction with OO<sup>∗</sup> with rates that increase with <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 pressure, but reach constant values as all OO<sup>∗</sup> species react with <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6 at high <sub>C</sub>3<sub>H</sub>6/alkanol ratios. Asymptotic epoxidation/ODH rate ratios are smaller than unity, because outer-sphere routes that shuttle O-atoms via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(g) are favored over endoergic vacancy formation required for inner-sphere routes. The relative contributions of these two routes are influenced by H<sub>2</sub>O, because vacancies, required to form OO<sup>∗</sup>, react with H<sub>2</sub>O to form OH pairs and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. OO<sup>∗</sup>-mediated routes and epoxidation become favored at low coverages of reduced centers, prevalent for less reactive alkanols and lower alkanol/O<sub>2</sub> ratios, because H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> then reacts preferentially with O∗ (forming OO<sup>∗</sup>), instead of vacancies (forming O∗/H<sub>2</sub>O). Such kinetic shunts between two routes compensate for lower barriers required to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than OO<sup>∗</sup>. These re-oxidation routes prefer molecular donor (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or acceptor (alkanol) to perform stepwise two-electron oxidations by dioxygen, instead of kinetically demanding O-atom migrations. The quantitative descriptions, derived from theory and experiment on Mo-based polyoxometalate clusters with known structures, bring together the dioxygen chemistry in liquid-phase oxidations, including electro-catalysis and monooxygenase enzymes, and oxide surfaces into a common framework, while suggesting a practical process for epoxidation by kinetically coupling with ODH reaction.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
        Converting CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable C1 products such as CO, methanol, and methane using photocatalysts is an attractive way to recycle atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> into fine chemicals and fuels. The most commonly studied photocatalyst, TiO<sub>2</sub>, however, suffers from poor initial adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. To overcome this problem, it has been proposed that a thin overlayer of a basic oxide might promote CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and thus improve the reactivity of TiO<sub>2</sub> for photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. In this work, we investigated CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption on the (100) surfaces of a series of basic, alkaline-earth metal oxides (MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO). Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption becomes significantly more favorable in the order MgO < CaO < SrO < BaO, and we attribute this order to the more suitable lattice parameter of BaO compared to MgO. To understand the effect of a thin layer of basic oxide on TiO<sub>2</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, SrO on TiO<sub>2</sub> was investigated as a model system. A dramatic improvement in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation was observed on SrO/TiO<sub>2</sub> compared to the bare TiO<sub>2</sub>, and dissociated water was found to be thermodynamically more favorable than intact water on the SrO/TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. A possible reaction route for the photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO on the bare and SrO-modified TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces was further investigated. Although the reaction is slightly more favorable on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface than on the 0.5 ML SrO-covered TiO<sub>2</sub>, the SrO half layer helps activate CO<sub>2</sub> and favors desorption of CO, which are challenging steps for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction on pure TiO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, our results suggest that <1 ML SrO overlayer might be a promising candidate for further experimental exploration.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
        A kinetic analysis of gas-phase cyclohexene epoxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> over mesoporous TS-1 was performed. The production of cyclohexene oxide was very stable with high selectivity. Based on the kinetic analysis, the gas-phase mechanism is proposed to be similar to that of the liquid-phase reaction: an Eley–Rideal type mechanism, in which the reaction between a Ti–OOH intermediate and the physisorbed alkene is the rate-determining step. When the partial pressure of water or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was varied, a compensation effect was observed. Based on the kinetic model, the compensation effect is attributed to variations in the surface coverage of intermediates, specifically the competitive adsorption of water and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the Ti active sites. A meaningful activation energy can only be obtained at high surface coverages of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and was determined to be 40 ± 2 kJ/mol.

Different chemoselectivities are observed, both substrate- and oxidant-dependent. A moderate enantioselectivity is also obtained in the case of prochiral precursors, revealing the chiral induction ability of the optically pure metal environment. The interaction of O<sub>2</sub> with the exposed metal sites in 1 (after material preactivation and consequent removal of the coordinated aquo ligand) has been studied through TPD-MS analysis combined with DFT calculations, with the aim of probing effective oxygen uptake by the heterogeneous catalyst and unraveling the nature of the active species in the catalytic oxidation process under aerobic conditions. Theoretical results indicate the presence of an η1-superoxo species at the cobalt center, with concomitant Co(II) ↔ Co(III) oxidation. Finally, the experimental estimation of the O<sub>2</sub> adsorption enthalpy is found to be in good agreement with the calculated binding energy.

        Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received attention for a myriad of potential applications including catalysis, gas storage, and gas separation. Coordinatively unsaturated metal ions often enable key functional behavior of these materials. Most commonly, MOFs have been metalated from the condensed phase (i.e., from solution). Here we introduce a new synthetic strategy capable of metallating MOFs from the gas phase: atomic layer deposition (ALD). Key to enabling metalation by ALD In MOFs (AIM) was the synthesis of NU-1000, a new, thermally stable, Zr-based MOF with spatially oriented −OH groups and large 1D mesopores and apertures.
