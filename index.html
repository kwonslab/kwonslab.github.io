<h2>Welcome to the Lab of CATS!</h2>
We study surface reactions in heterogeneous catalysis. Through an atomic-level understanding of reactions and active sites in catalytic materials, we design novel catalysts with improved reactivity and selectivity. We believe that our research will ultimately lower energy requirements and improve atomic efficiencies for current chemical processes and solve the environmental problems that we face today.
