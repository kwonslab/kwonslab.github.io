## Congratulations to Emily and Michelle for being nominated for the prestigious Rath Research Award 
Congratulations to Emily and Michelle for being nominated for the prestigious Rath Research Award, two of only six candidates selected across the entire campus! Each year, at Commencement, the Colorado School of Mines Office of Research and Technology Transfer presents this award to a doctoral graduate whose thesis demonstrates the greatest potential for societal impact.   

Both Emily and Michelle’s innovative research reflect the highest standards of excellence, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology in ways that could transform industries and communities. Emily’s work on the catalyst development for low temperature water electrolysis, and Michelle’s groundbreaking computational modeling of catalytic environments, are prime examples of research that could have lasting, positive effects on the world.    

Thank you, Emily and Michelle, for your dedication to advancing science and engineering, and for the exceptional contributions you’ve made to your fields. We are excited to see where your work takes you, and proud to have you both representing Mines at this level!
