## Congrats, Manasi for the ACS travel award! 

Manasi is awarded ACS CATL Division ChemCatBio Travel Award to present her work at the ACS Fall meeting. She will be giving two oral presentations, titled [Tailoring local environments around active sites on TiO2 for controlling product selectivity in aldol condensation catalysis](https://acs.digitellinc.com/p/s/tailoring-local-environments-around-active-sites-on-tio2-for-controlling-product-selectivity-in-aldol-condensation-catalysis-605059) and [Impacts of Pdâ€“PdO phase transformation and Pd/PdO nanoparticle sizes on H2O2 synthesis and decomposition pathways](https://acs.digitellinc.com/p/s/impacts-of-pd-pdo-phase-transformation-and-pdpdo-nanoparticle-sizes-on-h2o2-synthesis-and-decomposition-pathways-607581). Congrats! See you all at the ACS meeting!
