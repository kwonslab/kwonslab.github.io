##  Congratulations to Kay for receiving the Kokes Award
Kay was selected as a recipient of the prestigious Kokes Award from the North American Catalysis Society to attend the 29th North American Meeting (NAM), held in Atlanta. The Kokes Awards, sponsored by the North American Catalysis Society and administered by the NAM organization, recognize outstanding graduate students in catalysis and support their participation in this premier conference.  

At the meeting, Kay will present her research in a talk titled:
"Toluene Alkylation with Ethylene on Acidic Mordenite Zeolite: The Role of Proton Location in Catalysis."  

We’re excited to see her share her work with the broader catalysis community—see you all in Atlanta!
